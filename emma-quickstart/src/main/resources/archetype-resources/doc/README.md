The [emma-quickstart]() module contains a maven archetype to quickly setup and run an Emma project.

To get started, download the emma-quickstart module (e.g. to `~/Downloads`), go to the directory you want to create your project in (e.g. `~/projects/emma`) and execute the `emma-quickstart.sh` script.
This generates a maven project from the archetype that you can then import into your favorite IDE.
If you want to use a distributed runtime (even if just locally) you should activate on of the available maven profiles (`flink` or `spark`). Otherwise it will still run as a Scala program without any further configurations.

The project includes a basic frame for an out-of-the-box [Emma Job](http://link-to-job) and a corresponding integration test in the `src/test` package. The `main/Job.scala` provides a framework to try out Emma and implement your first programs. You can test your programs on different runtimes by running the `JobTest.scala` in the `src/test` package.
